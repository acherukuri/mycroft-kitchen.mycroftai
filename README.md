# Use Case I3-MA: Mycroft-AI–Home Assistant
### Kitchen Assistant
# Built a voice assistant for the kitchen of tomorrow using Mycroft AI which answers the following
### Examples:
### ●“Hey Mycroft, what is the <recipe/ingredients> for <dish_name>
### ●“Hey Mycroft, how to <cook/prepare/make/> a <recipe>
### ●“Hey Mycroft, what can I substitute for paprika?”
### ●“Hey  Mycroft,  what  can  I  make  from  the  ingredients  I  have  on  hand?”> What do you have on hand?> apples, onions, milk and eggs> Do you have olive oil? ...
### ●“Hey Mycroft, how many Weight Watcher Point does spaghetti have?”


# Installation: 
Follow this for the setup https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/introduction-developing-skills/

# Steps:
### We have used a padatious intent for finding ingredients for a recipe or a dish
### Basically, it makes api call to Edamam Recipe Serach API to get the ingredients of the recipe.
### Once we get the response, MyCroft will speak out the ingredient names.
###
### We have used another padatious intent for finding instructions to make the recipe.
### This makes API call to Rapid API to get instructions to make the recipe.
### Once we get the response, MyCroft will speak out the instructions to make the recipe.
### Integrated the skill with the Mycroft Mark-1 device in real time
